# Javascript-Platformer
A platformer game made with HTML Canvas and Javascript

This game is made on HTML Canvas and used VanillaJS, HTML, CSS. This was my school project and done couple months ago. The challange was make a 2D platformer game without using a game engine by this means i learned a lot about game development fundamentals.

Anyone can just download and play it through browser(chrome recomended) and have benefit from source code.

Here is some of images from interface;
